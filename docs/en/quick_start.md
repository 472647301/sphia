# Quick Start

Click the `...` button in the upper right corner of the server page to add a server or group. You can manually enter
server information, import server information from the clipboard, or import server information from a subscription (you
need to create a group).

Sphia **will not** carry any core, you need to switch to the update page to download the core and corresponding rule
data. After ensuring that the core and rule data are downloaded, you can click the button in the lower right corner of
the server page to start the core, or start the core in the tray icon menu.

Sphia does not support PAC.

If you only need a system proxy, please open "Automatically configure system proxy" in the "Proxy" tab in the settings
page.
